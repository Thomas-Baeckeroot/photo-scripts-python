# Scripts to automate picture/photo management

Couple of scripts (in Python) to manage pictures:


### sort_photos.py
> To be launched right after having downloaded pictures from digital camera.
> It aims to organize raw files in a separated folder, group set of pictures in one folder,
> geo-tags pictures if a .gpx file is given.

### create_panorama.py
> Automates assembly of panorama from files in a folder.
> This script performs some actions that are generally done manually in Hugin to create a panorama.
> Result is without warranty but at least should give a decent draft.
> 
> <u>Note</u>: It has been broken by some hugin update around 2020/2022, I'll fix it some day...
